# Welcome 👋

My name is Ioannis, I'm a 4th year **Electrical Engineering** (B.Eng) student with a double minor is Statistics and Business at McMaster University. Graduating **April 2027**.

Currently leading the inverter project at [Mac Formula Electric](https://macformularacing.com/). 

## Previously
**Drive Inverter EE Design Intern @ [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)** - *Palo Alto, California* (January -- July 2025)

- Designed, prototyped and tested a novel gate-driver circuit to improve the efficiency of high-power parallel SiC-MOSFET power converters (>500V and >1kA).

- Did the schematic, PCB layout and routing for a 6-layer board stackup with over 700 total components.
Prepared a complete fabrication package including fab directives, DFM/BOM checks and assembly documentation for the PCBA release.

- Performed high-fidelity transient simulations to model high-speed events in switching transitions and model device-device interaction. Extracted critical circuit parasitics, such as R, L and C to optimize PCB layout for fast switching and low EMI.

- Used isolated high-voltage and high-CMRR probes, Rogowski coils and current transducers to perform double-pulse tests (DPTs). Used impedance analyzer to test high-frequency magnetics.

- Automated data parsing and result analysis in MATLAB and Python to assist manufacturing, test and FA teams. Presented results and contributed regularly to team meetings, DFMEAs, phase exits and cross-functional syncs with teams across North America, Europe and China.

**RF Hardware Developer Intern @ [Geotab](https://www.geotab.com/)** - *Oakville, Ontario* (May -- December 2024)

 - Used vector network analyzer (VNA) to extract S-parameters to characterize filters and LNAs in RF front-end (RFFE) for flagship IoT device. Re-worked components down to 0201 size to isolate and test different circuit elements.

 - Performed conducted and radiated verification measurements using spectrum analyzer and radio communication analyzer (callbox) for WLAN (IEEE 802.11 b/g/n), BT, BLE and LTE (CAT 1.bis and CAT-M1) protocols.

 - Calculated and simulated matching network for commercial GNSS modules and verified results (S11) with VNA measurements.

 - Evaluated power consumption and efficiency of LTE modems at varying temperatures using a thermal chamber and power profiler.

 - Developed Python scripts to automate data parsing and visualization for benchmarking commercial GNSS modules in terms of accuracy, convergence and time to first fix (TTFF).

**Research Assistant @ [McMaster University](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/sept/)** - *Hamilton, Ontario* (Summer 2022)

- Developed custom controls for a quadcopter drone using the SDK in Python, allowing remote control by a laptop computer.

- Used OpenCV face detection algorithms to recognize and track human faces and implemented an optimized PID controller to correct the drone’s path in real-time.
