# Leidenfrost Maze

This is a project (arguably the first completed) I worked on while in middle school in Greece. I made a video about it a while back, you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Lx9d1zKAs) on YouTube. I also wrote a paper and was accepted to present it at the Anatolia College Science and Technology Annual Conference (ACSTAC) in Thessaloniki, though I didn't end up going due to timing reasons. You can read it below:
