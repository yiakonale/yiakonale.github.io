In nearly all cameras digital or analog, it comes down to the shutter speed. The shutter speed dictates how long the sensor (analog or digital) is exposed for, and therefore the \"speed\" of the photo. Regular digital cameras can expose a photo to 1/250 or 1/500 of a second. The fastest camera I own is an SLR with a mechanical shutter that can do 1/4000 of a second, which means that the film is exposed for 250us. One can optimize for faster and faster shutter speeds but the next bottleneck becomes the sensor itself. The less time you expose for, the less light the sensor can absorb. You can optimize for maximum light sensitivity but that's when the cost also skyrockets.</p> <p>One workaround to this, is instead of relying on an ultra-fast shutter for quick exposure, instead using an ultra-fast light source to expose the event. The camera is set up to take a long exposure with large aperture and in complete darkness. When the event is you wish to capture takes place, the light source is triggered and exposes the scene for a very short instant. This works in the reverse way as before, as we now control the light source and leave the shutter wide open. The advantage to doing this is that you can use any regular camera, so long as you can take a long exposure. In order to know when you should pulse the light source, you need a way of knowing when your event is taking place, and very quickly trigger the flashlamp.</p>"},{"location":"projects/leidenfrost/","title":"Leidenfrost","text":"<p>**Leidenfrost Maze\"</p>"},{"location":"projects/ultrasonic-levitator/","title":"Acoustic Ultrasonic Levitator","text":"<p>Page under construction.
