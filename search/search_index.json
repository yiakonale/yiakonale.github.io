Originally from Athens, Greece, I moved to Canada to pursue my studies. My interest in power electronics started when I was a kid visiting science museums and watching Tesla coils make huge arcs, and I always wondered how they worked. Since high school, I've been doing various electronics projects as a hobby and constantly experimenting with new ideas.</p> <p>Later in high school, I became interested in physics and chemistry and seriously considered pursuing a degree in theoretical physics. Around that time, I started watching electronics videos online and wanted to replicate many of the experiments I saw there, so I decided to learn PCB design and started reading more about circuits. I spent many hours of my free time using an old soldering iron to salvage components from old TVs and appliances, with the hope of reusing them in later projects. This helped me understand how some of these circuits work and become familiar with the different types of electronics. I found that I was particularly drawn to large components (inductors and transformers), which usually happened to be part of some power converter. Eventually, I started making my own projects, starting with none other than the humble Tesla coil. I also became accustomed to some of the more prominent aspects of hardware engineering, like designing a circuit that doesn't work at all and spending hours locating and fixing a poor solder joint. Naturally, this pushed me toward choosing EE as my major.</p> <p>By the time I started university, I was already fairly comfortable with PCB design, and my soldering skills were getting better. I began working on more ambitious projects, and I grew more confident in my abilities. I also started learning more about power converters, and I joined the university's FSAE Electric team. From then on, my EE skills and knowledge have grown exponentially, and I'm still learning new things, starting as a general member and later becoming a team lead working on high-power inverter and motor drive systems.</p> <p>My main interest lies in power electronics. I enjoy pretty much every aspect of it: simulation, modelling, design, validation, and testing, from both a hardware and a software/controls perspective. More recently, I decided to branch into the world of radio and high-frequency design, which also ties closely to my interest for physics. In the future, I would like to combine the two in projects such as wireless power and high-frequnecy converters. I enjoy working on electronics in almost any scenario and would love to explore other industries, like drones or robotics. Going forward, I want to strengthen my software skills, especially in embedded systems, and become a true \u201cfull-stack\u201d EE. I'm also interested in eventually exploring photonics, microelectronics and IC design, digital circuits, FPGAs, and VLSI design, as well as machine learning and applications of AI in hardware.</p>"},{"location":"projects/high-speed-photography-v1/","title":"High Speed Photography Unit V1","text":"<p>The problem with capturing high-speed photos boils down to how fast the camera can sample the subject. In nearly all cameras digital or analog, it comes down to the shutter speed. The shutter speed dictates how long the sensor (analog or digital) is exposed for, and therefore the \"speed\" of the photo. Regular digital cameras can expose a photo to 1/250 or 1/500 of a second. The fastest camera I own is an SLR with a mechanical shutter that can do 1/4000 of a second, which means that the film is exposed for 250us. One can optimize for faster and faster shutter speeds but the next bottleneck becomes the sensor itself. The less time you expose for, the less light the sensor can absorb. You can optimize for maximum light sensitivity but that's when the cost also skyrockets.</p> <p>One workaround to this, is instead of relying on an ultra-fast shutter for quick exposure, instead using an ultra-fast light source to expose the event. The camera is set up to take a long exposure with large aperture and in complete darkness. When the event is you wish to capture takes place, the light source is triggered and exposes the scene for a very short instant. This works in the reverse way as before, as we now control the light source and leave the shutter wide open. The advantage to doing this is that you can use any regular camera, so long as you can take a long exposure. In order to know when you should pulse the light source, you need a way of knowing when your event is taking place, and very quickly trigger the flashlamp.</p>"},{"location":"projects/leidenfrost/","title":"Leidenfrost","text":"<p>Leidenfrost Maze</p>"},{"location":"projects/pcb/","title":"Pcb","text":"<p>Leidenfrost Maze</p>"},{"location":"projects/ultrasonic-levitator/","title":"Acoustic Ultrasonic Levitator","text":"<p>Page under construction.
