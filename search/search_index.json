Originally from Athens, Greece, I moved to Canada to pursue my studies. My interest in electronics started when I was a kid visiting science museums and watching Tesla coils make huge arcs, and I always wondered how they worked. Since high school, I've been doing various electronics projects as a hobby and constantly experimenting with new ideas.</p> <p>Later in high school, I became interested in physics and chemistry and seriously considered pursuing a degree in theoretical physics. Around that time, I started watching electronics videos online and wanted to replicate many of the experiments I saw there, so I decided to learn PCB design and started reading more about circuits. I spent many hours of my free time using an old soldering iron to salvage components from old TVs and appliances, with the hope of reusing them in later projects. This helped me understand how some of these circuits work and become familiar with the different types of electronics. I found that I was particularly drawn to large components (inductors and transformers), which usually happened to be part of some power converter. Eventually, I started making my own projects, starting with none other than the humble Tesla coil. I also became accustomed to some of the more prominent aspects of hardware engineering, like designing a circuit that doesn't work at all and spending hours locating and fixing a poor solder joint. Naturally, this pushed me toward choosing EE as my major.</p> <p>By the time I started university, I was already fairly comfortable with PCB design, and my soldering skills were getting better. I began working on more ambitious projects, and I grew more confident in my abilities. I also started learning more about power converters, and I joined the university's FSAE Electric team. From then on, my EE skills and knowledge have grown exponentially, and I'm still learning new things, starting as a general member and later becoming a team lead working on high-power inverter and motor drive systems.</p> <p>My main interest lies in power electronics. I enjoy pretty much every aspect of it: simulation, modelling, design, validation, and testing, from both a hardware and a software/controls perspective. More recently, I decided to branch into the world of radio and high-frequency design, which also ties closely to my interest for physics. In the future, I would like to combine the two in projects such as wireless power and high-frequnecy converters. I enjoy working on electronics in almost any scenario and would love to explore other industries, like drones or robotics. Going forward, I want to strengthen my software skills, especially in embedded systems, and become a true \u201cfull-stack\u201d EE. I'm also interested in eventually exploring photonics, microelectronics and IC design, digital circuits, FPGAs, and VLSI design, as well as machine learning and applications of AI in hardware.</p>"},{"location":"projects/dog_whistle/","title":"Portable Canine Silencer","text":"<p>This was a quick weekend project I put together a while ago. It\u2019s not especially practical, but it was fun to build and experiment with.</p>"},{"location":"projects/high-speed-photography-v1/","title":"High Speed Photography Unit V1","text":"<p>The problem with capturing high-speed photos boils down to how fast the camera can sample the subject. In nearly all cameras digital or analog, it comes down to the shutter speed. The shutter speed dictates how long the sensor (analog or digital) is exposed for, and therefore the \"speed\" of the photo. Regular digital cameras can expose a photo to 1/250 or 1/500 of a second. The fastest camera I own is an SLR with a mechanical shutter that can do 1/4000 of a second, which means that the film is exposed for 250us. One can optimize for faster and faster shutter speeds but the next bottleneck becomes the sensor itself. The less time you expose for, the less light the sensor can absorb. You can optimize for maximum light sensitivity but that's when the cost also skyrockets.</p> <p>One workaround to this, is instead of relying on an ultra-fast shutter for quick exposure, instead using an ultra-fast light source to expose the event. The camera is set up to take a long exposure with large aperture and in complete darkness. When the event is you wish to capture takes place, the light source is triggered and exposes the scene for a very short instant. This works in the reverse way as before, as we now control the light source and leave the shutter wide open. The advantage to doing this is that you can use any regular camera, so long as you can take a long exposure. In order to know when you should pulse the light source, you need a way of knowing when your event is taking place, and very quickly trigger the flashlamp.</p>"},{"location":"projects/leidenfrost/","title":"Leidenfrost Maze","text":""},{"location":"projects/pcb/","title":"PCB Designs","text":""},{"location":"projects/pcb/#high-voltage-distribution-board-rev-2-hvd-r2","title":"High-Voltage Distribution Board Rev 2 (HVD-R2)","text":"<p>This is a PCB I designed for McMaster's FSAE Electric design team - Mac Formula Electric, during Winter 2025 using Altium Designer.</p> <p>It uses a four-layer stackup with 4 oz internal and external copper weight.</p> <p>This board sits between the high-voltage battery and the inverter, and its main functions are to:</p> <ol> <li>Facilitate the high-current path from the battery to the inverter</li> <li>Provide high-current connection points for the energy meter (EM) and manual service disconnect (MSD)</li> <li>Implement discharge for the high-voltage bus</li> <li>Provide LV power to the EM</li> <li>Facilitate high-voltage interlock loop (HVIL) connections for the EM, MSD, inverter, and HVDC connector</li> <li>Provide CM/DM (common mode/differential mode) filtering for the HV bus</li> </ol> <p>The heavy copper weight on all layers is necessary, as it must conduct the full 50\u201360 A DC of the tractive system to the inverter. This significantly increases manufacturing costs, so it\u2019s not ideal. Bus discharge is implemented using an array of 2 W SMD resistors and a normally-closed (NC) relay, which can discharge the inverter capacitors to &lt;50 V in under 5 seconds, as required by FSAE rules. When the car is in the driving state, the relay coil is powered and the discharge array is disconnected from the bus. In the event of loss of LV power or another fault condition, the relay automatically closes to safely discharge the HV bus. A fast antiparallel diode is placed across the relay\u2019s LV terminals to prevent inductive flyback.</p> <p>The energy meter and MSD terminals are bolted to the PCB using locknuts. These also serve as the mounting points for the PCB itself, as the MSD and EM are bolted onto the chassis and inverter enclosure, respectively.</p> <p>The HVIL circuit consists of automotive-qualified connectors placed in series. When all connectors are mated, the HVIL circuit can power the downstream node. The copper weight is completely overkill for this circuit, so the space utilization is fairly poor. In the future, the HVIL portion will be moved off-board to save on board space and cost.</p> <p>Some rudimentary common-mode filtering was attempted by placing two sets of Y-capacitors across the HV lines to chassis ground. Due to the strict clearance requirements in FSAE, placing them on the board wasn\u2019t trivial and only allowed for relatively small capacitor footprints. The effect of these capacitors was likely negligible, as there was no provision for a direct PCB-to-enclosure connection, and a long, thin wire was used instead. This introduces significant inductance, making the capacitors ineffective for this purpose. In the next iteration, there will be a dedicated mounting point on the metal enclosure for a low-impedance ground connection. Additionally, there was no available space on the board to fit any X-capacitors.</p> HVD-R2 integrated into the inverter enclosure <p>Many thanks to Rahim for the beautiful renders!</p>"},{"location":"projects/pcb/#voltage-tap-board","title":"Voltage Tap Board","text":"<p>This is another PCB I designed for Mac Formula Electric in Winter 2023 using Altium Designer.</p> <p>This is the first PCB I designed completely by myself that was included in the race car (MAC-EV4). Its function is quite straightforward: it simply \u201ctaps\u201d off the positive terminal of each battery module within each segment and provides this voltage to the BMS for sensing each module. There are 144 series modules in the battery, 24 in each segment, each containing 5 cells in parallel, for a total of 720 cells. The BMS only interfaces with each module individually, so it can balance 5 cells at most with 144 taps. Since there are 6 partitions or \u201csegments\u201d in the battery, each PCB is responsible for collecting the voltage of 24 modules, hence the two 12-pin connectors. This also makes this board by far the largest in size among the vehicle PCBs, but not the most expensive due to the simple 2-layer stackup. Each line also needs to be fused, so a small 1 A surface-mount fuse is soldered in series with each voltage line to the BMS.</p> <p>Since there are 6 segments that make up the HV battery, 6 of these boards are used in the car. Each PCB is placed directly on top of the copper busbars that connect each module in series, so care was taken to prevent any shorts from occurring within the battery. As a result, no traces were routed on the bottom layer (touching the exposed busbars), and the tap traces were spaced as far as possible from live sources. Since the pads do not conduct any current and are simply used for mechanical fastening to the modules, solder mask was applied to cover any exposed copper and ensure good insulation.</p> <p>In future iterations of this board, its functions were extended to include the series busbar connections for the modules inside the PCB itself. This was done using multiple heavy-weight copper traces, similar to HVD-R2. This also made this PCB the most expensive board in the vehicle, but packaging and assembly of the battery were improved drastically because of this.</p> Voltage tap board bare PCB"},{"location":"projects/ultrasonic-levitator/","title":"Acoustic Ultrasonic Levitator","text":""}]}
